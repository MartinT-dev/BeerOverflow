# BeerOverflow
Project Description

Welcome to BeerOverflow, a web application for managing users and the beers they drink.  
The mission of BeerOverflow is to allow users to get an insight on beers from all around the world and choose the next best beer to drink. 
Apart from the subjective criteria like being rated or reviewed by users, a beer must satisfy the minimal labeling requirements as per EU laws: 
•	Name.
•	Type - Porter, Ale, Lager etc.
•	Brewery.
•	Alcohol By Volume % .
 
BeerOverflow is a community driven web app and every beer aficionado can add, review and rate beers.
